## HTML:

Project title : Cantor

In this file there are tags and attributes that divide the document into:
`<body> <header> <section> <article> <footer>` and on `<form> <table>`.

- `<body>` - contains the entire content.

- `<header>` - contains the page title.

- `<section>` - divides the article into sections. In my case, it's more important than `<article>`.

- `<article>` - divides the sections into two smaller topics.

- `<footer>` - the source of the information on the page is given in the footer.

- `<form>` - the form converts Polish currency into all currencies.

- `<table>`  - table makes it easy to organize the content.

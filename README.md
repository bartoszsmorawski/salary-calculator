## General description:

This page was created as homework to practice creating a form.

The form on the website **The salary calculator converts the gross rate (with tax) into the net rate (without tax)**, **Thanks to it, we know how much we will earn per month.**.

Calculations on the website are current for **2024**.

## Technologies used:

- HTML
- JavaScript
- CSS
- BEM convention
- Normalize
- GIT

## Folders:

The files include folders such as : **css, js, images** and **index.html**.

## CSS:

This folder is divided into **5 files** : **article.css, form.css, header.css, section.css, style.css, table.css**. Each of them steels individual elements on the page.

## JavaScript:

In this folder there is a **script.js** file in which **an algorithm** is written that **converts** the Polish salary gross (with TAX) into net (without TAX), and vice versa.

## HTML:

Project title : Kalkulator wynagrodzenia

In this file there are tags and attributes that divide the document into:
`<body> <header> <section> <article>` and on `<form>`.

- `<body>` - contains the entire content.

- `<header>` - contains the page title.

- `<section>` - divides the article into sections. In my case, it's more important than `<article>`.

- `<article>` - divides the sections into two smaller topics.

- `<form>` - the form converts Polish currency into all currencies.

## Font

The font used for the project is **"LATO"** downloaded from **Google Fonts**.
**Link to the font**: https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Lato:ital,wght@0,300;1,300;1,400&display=swap"
